In the projects for this course, the main problem was to develop a course planner program that efficiently manages and displays information about Computer Science courses. This involved tasks such as reading data from a file, creating and managing data structures, implementing a menu system, and ensuring the program's functionality according to specified requirements.

To approach the problem, I began by carefully analyzing the requirements and identifying the necessary components for the program. I chose a tree data structure to represent the course relationships, considering the hierarchical nature of course prerequisites. Understanding data structures was crucial in this context as it allowed for efficient organization and retrieval of course information, reflecting the real-world relationships between courses.

During the activities and project, I encountered challenges in implementing certain functionalities, such as loading data from a file and sorting courses. To overcome these roadblocks, I applied problem-solving techniques, consulted documentation, and iteratively tested and debugged the code. Collaboration with peers and leveraging online resources also contributed to overcoming challenges.

Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate data structures based on the specific requirements. It highlighted the significance of code readability, maintainability, and adaptability for future enhancements or modifications. I learned to balance efficiency and simplicity in code design to ensure a robust and scalable solution.

The project has evolved the way I write programs by instilling the importance of modular and well-documented code. It reinforced the significance of adhering to best practices, using meaningful variable and function names, and incorporating comments for clarity. This approach ensures that the code is not only functional but also comprehensible and maintainable, benefiting both the developer and potential collaborators.
